# EV-Adoption-Trends-Global-vs-US 🚗🔌🌍🇺🇸

This project provides a comparative analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends globally and in the United States using publicly available datasets. Using data analytics and visualization, the goal is to identify key patterns, regional differences, and technology preferences shaping the EV landscape.

# Libraries used in this project include:

1. pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning
2. matplotlib.pyplot – for creating static plots
3. matplotlib.ticker – for customizing plot axes (used internally via matplotlib)
4. seaborn – for advanced statistical visualizations
5. plotly.express – for interactive charts and maps (Choropleth Map)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores:

- How U.S. EV adoption compares to global trends  
- Which U.S. regions lead or lag in EV uptake  
- Key differences in EV types, categories, and technologies  

The notebook uses visualizations such as bar charts, choropleth maps, and pie charts to help answer the key research questions.

## Future Improvements

- Include more diverse or real-time data sources (e.g., APIs)  
- Consider policy, environmental, and social impact factors  
- Extend the project with time-series forecasting or predictive modeling
